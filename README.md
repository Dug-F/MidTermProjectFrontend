<h1>Bootcamp Resources Mid-Term Project by Async Avatars</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The brief for the mid-term project was to produce an app that could help fellow bootcampers.  We were divided into teams of 6 with people with whom we had (mostly) not previously worked.  We became team Async Avatars.

The School of Code bootcamp is extremely intense and presents bootcampers with a torrent of information at a rapid pace.  The information is in disparate places: documents, presentations, Slack channel, partial or completed code to name a few.  We identified this as an opportunity to help our fellow bootcampers - create an app to help organise bootcamp resources.

<h2>What We Produced</h2>

Our journey as a team, including a demo of the app is show in the video below (the demo starts at about 2:50):

You can find a link to the deployed site above or at the right-side of this page.  Please note that the hosting service hibernates the backend api after inactivity and there may be a delay of c. 20 secs before the app becomes fully operable on first access.

Because the app uses links that are personal to individual bootcampers, some of the links may appear broken for users that were not in the bootcamp.  For those users, viewing the demo in the above video is recommended.
