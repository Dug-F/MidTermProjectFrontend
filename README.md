The brief for the mid-term project was to produce an app that could help fellow bootcampers.  We were divided into teams of 6 with people with whom we had (nostly) not previously worked.  We became team Async Avatars.

The School of Code bootcamp is extremely intense and presents bootcampers with a torrent of information at a rapid pace.  The information is in disparate places: documents, presentations, Slack channel, partial or completed code to name a few.  We identified this as an opportunity to help our fellow bootcampers - create an app to help organise bootcamp resources.

Our journey as a team, including a demo of the app is show in the video below:
